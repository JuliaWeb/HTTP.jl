    safer_joinpath(basepart, parts...)
A variation on `joinpath`, that is more resistant to directory traversal attacks.
The parts to be joined (excluding the `basepart`),
are not allowed to contain `..`, or begin with a `/`.
If they do then this throws an `DomainError`.

    download(url, [local_path], [headers]; update_period=1, kw...)

Similar to `Base.download` this downloads a file, returning the filename.
If the `local_path`:
 - is not provided, then it is saved in a temporary directory
 - if part to a directory is provided then it is saved into that directory
 - otherwise the local path is uses as the filename to save to.

When saving into a directory, the filename is determined (where possible),
from the rules of the HTTP.

 - `update_period` controls how often (in seconds) to report the progress.
    - set to `Inf` to disable reporting
 - `headers` specifies headers to be used for the HTTP GET request
 - any additional keyword args (`kw...`) are passed on to the HTTP request.
