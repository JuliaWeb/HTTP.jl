    CookieJar()

A thread-safe object for storing cookies returned in "Set-Cookie"
response headers. Keyed by appropriate host from the original request made.
Can be created manually and passed like `HTTP.get(url; cookiejar=mycookiejar)`
to avoid using the default global `CookieJar`. The 2 main functions for
interacting with a `CookieJar` are [`Cookies.getcookies!`](@ref), which
returns a `Vector{Cookie}` for a given url (and will remove expired cookies
from the jar), and [`Cookies.setcookies!`](@ref), which will store "Set-Cookie"
response headers in the cookie jar.
