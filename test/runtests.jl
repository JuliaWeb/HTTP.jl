# https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3
# The normal procedure for parsing an HTTP message is to read the
#   start-line into a structure, read each header field into a hash table
#   by field name until the empty line, and then use the parsed data to
#   determine if a message body is expected.  If a message body has been
#   indicated, then it is read as a stream until an amount of octets
#   equal to the message body length is read or the connection is closed.

# A sender MUST NOT send whitespace between the start-line and the
#    first header field.  A recipient that receives whitespace between the
#    start-line and the first header field MUST either reject the message
#    as invalid or consume each whitespace-preceded line without further
#    processing of it (i.e., ignore the entire line, along with any
#    subsequent lines preceded by whitespace, until a properly formed
#    header field is received or the header section is terminated).

# reject a received request: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.1
# restrict uri length to 8000 by default: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.1.1

# https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.2
# handle response w/ multiple "Set-Cookie" header fields

# https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3
# never a repsonse body in HEAD/CONNECT requests
# 1xx, 204, 304 don't include bodies
